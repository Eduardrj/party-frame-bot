2026-02-02 18:14 UTC - Incident and remediation log

Resumo:
- Detectado: OpenClaw gateway temporarily exposed (bind changed to 0.0.0.0) and a WhatsApp connector could not connect ("Connection refused").
- Ação inicial: Edited ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json to change gateway.bind from "loopback" to "0.0.0.0" to restore connectivity (performed earlier during troubleshooting).
- Consequence: WhatsApp gateway connected as +5511933428373 shortly after.

Remediation steps performed (by assistant) on authorization (Rotacionar+Audit):
- 2026-02-02 18:14 UTC: Rotated gateway token (new token prefix: bd659e534517...). Updated ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json gateway.auth.token and gateway.remote.token. Restarted user service openclaw-gateway.
- 2026-02-02 18:14–18:15 UTC: Attempted audit of systemd journal for openclaw in the window 16:25–17:05 UTC; no entries found in the unit journal for that interval. Noted that gateway logs may be in /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-*.log instead.

Post-actions and status:
- Gateway currently set to bind=loopback (user restored backup after the exposure). Confirmed WhatsApp connector reconnected at 18:14 UTC and again at 20:01 UTC (brief disconnect at 20:01:41, reconnected at 20:01:44).
- Token rotated and applied. Backups were left intact (not modified) per instruction; backups available at ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak*.

Recommendations / next steps:
1) If desired, update the .bak files to reflect the new token (optional) or keep them as historical snapshots.
2) If you want a deeper audit, allow searching /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-*.log and container logs for the exposure window.
3) Prefer to keep gateway.bind=loopback and place connectors in the same network namespace or use secure tunneling (Tailscale/SSH/Traefik) for remote access.
4) Rotate any credentials that might have been exposed elsewhere during the incident if you suspect compromise.

Recorded by assistant on user authorization: ROTACIONAR+AUDIT (token rotation executed; audit attempted). No further changes will be made without explicit instruction.
