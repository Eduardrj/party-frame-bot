2026-02-04 UTC - Decision: keep OpenClaw gateway running as root

Summary:
- User decision: continue operating OpenClaw under the root user. The eduardo user must be left untouched for now.
- Action: assistant recorded the decision and environment note in memory so it won't prompt to migrate or reassign the gateway user again unless explicitly asked.

Details captured:
- Root linger/service: root's user systemd remains active (linger enabled or may be re-enabled). The OpenClaw gateway previously ran under root (port 18789). The eduardo user has a separate per-user install/state under /home/eduardo/.config/. This separation is intentional and will remain.
- Risk noted: running as root may create duplicate instances if eduardo also starts the gateway. User asked to leave eduardo quiet and continue with root.
- Restoration notes: if a future migration is requested, recommended steps include rsync from /root/.openclaw to /home/eduardo/.openclaw with permission fix, or setting a shared DATA_DIR and configuring systemd units accordingly.

Recorded state pointers (where to look later):
- Root config/data: /root/.openclaw/, /tmp/openclaw/, /root/.openclaw/openclaw.json and .bak*
- Eduardo config/data (do not modify): /home/eduardo/.openclaw/, /home/eduardo/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service

Operator notes:
- I will not attempt to migrate or modify eduardo's user files without explicit authorization.
- I will treat root as the active operator for gateway tasks until you instruct otherwise.

Recorded by assistant at user's instruction. If you want this appended into the main MEMORY.md instead, say "append-main"; otherwise this file will serve as the committed decision record.
