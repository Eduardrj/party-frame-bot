2026-02-03 UTC - Inventory of credential file paths (no secrets stored)

Purpose: index locations on the host where credentials, tokens or keys were found. This file contains only paths and a brief note; it does NOT contain secret values.

Files and locations:

- /root/.openclaw/credentials/supabase.key    # Supabase service role or anon key (file, perms 600)
- /root/.openclaw/credentials/supabase_pg.url # Postgres connection URL (may include host/user)
- /root/.openclaw/credentials/nodehost.token  # Node-host token for browser relay
- /root/.openclaw/openclaw.json               # Gateway config (contains gateway.auth.token / gateway.remote.token)
- /root/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak*          # Historical config snapshots (may include previous tokens)
- /root/.openclaw/backups/openclaw-backup-2026-02-02.tar.gz  # Backup archive (contains older tokens and bot tokens)
- .openclaw/telegram/bot.token (inside backup)               # Telegram bot token found in backup
- .openclaw/identity/device-auth.json (inside backup)        # Device auth file found in backup
- /root/.openclaw/workspace/agents_factory/prompt_clawdbot.txt  # contains agent prompt artifacts (no secrets expected)
- /root/.openclaw/workspace/interativixbot/ (repo)            # project files; may include SRK placeholders or templates with creds
- session logs (.jsonl) inside backup: .openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl  # may contain inline PGPASSWORD or API keys in command history

Notes and guidance:
- I did NOT copy or store any secret values here. This is an index only.
- Files inside the backup archive may contain sensitive tokens; treat the backup as sensitive.
- If you later authorize, I can extract specific files securely (write to a temporary path with restricted perms) for rotation or rotation instructions.

Recorded by assistant to avoid asking again for credential locations. If you want the inventory appended to MEMORY.md instead, tell me "append". To remove this inventory file, tell me "remove-inv".
